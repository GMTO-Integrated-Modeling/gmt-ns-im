# Closed-loop calibration between SH48 and M1 assembly tip and tilt

The calibration took place once the closed-loops between both the M1 edge
sensors and the M1 segment RBMs and the SH24 and the FSMS
has reached steady state.

THe calibration steps are:

 1. calibrate [M1 edge sensors](../../m1-edge-sensors/README.md)
 2. calibrate [SH24](../sh24/README.md)
 3. run `cargo r -r`
